The widespread perception of the Aztecs is wrong, to an alarming degree

Reading comments, watching videos, or looking at depictions of Aztecs (or really any pre-Columbian American people) in media or just on the internet, always shock me into remembering not to fall for the Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect. This is a term referring to the concept of people trusting newspapers or media on topics they aren't very familiar with, while also recognizing how wrong media often is about topics they have expertise in. Why do we so easily accept information on these unfamiliar topics if we know they can't get our familiar one right? You've probably asked your friend in an industry or from a location on the news about their opinion on the newsworthy events, or maybe have been the recipient yourself - it seems that the answer is almost always annoyance with the way the events or topic is depicted, or about how it was simply reported wrong, and the public doesn't get it.

I've seen a great deal of posts online that talk about history, and present a version that is either completely wrong or simplified to the point where it is not useful or even truthful at all. On Aztecs, this is practically every post - I see it on Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, book reviews, documentaries... anywhere you look, practically. Commenters often present themselves as experts, and deliver information that seems believable - so it shocks me when they speak as if they have authority on the subject and then spew misinformation. This isn't an article about how false information and suspicious narratives about the Aztecs became so popular - the answer to that is simple. Colonial-era Spanish propaganda, elementary school education, and the desire for dramatic and flashy history with heroes and villains cause simplified versions of the real history to spread easily. This happens to any topic in history, really. But it seems especially bad for the Aztecs. I've also seen what essentially amount to glorification and apology for the Aztecs on the internet, although it's not that common. That also isn't what this article is about. 

The goal here is to take the false information and revisionist narratives I see very often online, and use them to talk about the true history and culture of Mesoamerica. The format here will be to take common comments or narratives that I've seen, and talk about the real history while correcting them. Hopefully over the whole article, I can build a better image of what Aztec, and other Mesoamerican cultures in the area, actually looked like and were. And of course, I'll talk about the narrative of the Spanish colonial conquest - which is the lens through which most people know about and see the Aztecs. 

We'll start with the comment I hate the most, although not because it's the most offensive or ridiculous. It's just impossible to find a discussion on the Aztecs online that doesn't have some variation of this comment. It's one of those pop-history "facts" that people just seem to love to memorize and repeat, word for word. I mainly blame Jared Diamond, honestly.

"The Spanish were able to conquer the Aztecs because the Aztecs were so evil to the surrounding tribes that they instantly rebelled and joined the Spanish when Cort√©s arrived."

Nothing in here is completely true - it's almost entirely wrong. But it is taught in schools and in pop history books and podcasts like Blood, Germs, and Steel, so it's the prevailing view of the conquest. Here's why each part of it is wrong.
