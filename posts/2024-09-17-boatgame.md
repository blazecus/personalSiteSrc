Here's the game we came up with this time: <a href = "https://wavefriend.itch.io/boat-corp">Boat Corp</a>.

Simply put, this game needed more time to be finished. Maybe just one more day - we had all the mechanics in place, but there was no polish. The idea of the game wasn't too complicated - essentially, you needed to balance a fishing minigame with ship direction and maintenance. It seemed like a small enough scope when we came up with the plan for the game, but actually making it ended being an endless list of tasks. 

One aspect I was pretty proud of, actually, was the shader I made for the ocean view in the map. It played a small role in the game, and I probably spent more time on it than it deserved, even if it was only an hour or two, but I thought it looked pretty decent.
