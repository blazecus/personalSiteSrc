Unfinished online arena game, inspired by the bikes in Tron.

This is going to be a short post, because this is an unfinished game that I haven't worked on in a long time. I've implemented some decent graphics, the gameplay works, and I've even added networking with some decent netcode for client-side prediction and such. But I've been stuck on designing the 3D levels, as that takes some decent skill with 3D modeling and knowledge on level design. I'll leave a couple screenshots and make update posts as I continue to work on this game. Want to finish it pretty soon, even though it's been a year since I've really worked on it.

The flat game world looks like this. I made a Matrix-inspired shader for the skybox.

Particles for the "grinding" mechanic. Driving close to paths made by other bikes or your own is more dangerous, but gives you a speed boost as you "grind" against them.
