GMTK Game Jam 2024: "Built Scale"
</div>

<div class = "page-summary">
First game jam I've done since I started this website.

<hr>
<br>


First off, I'll link our game, <a href = "https://wavefriend.itch.io/subatomic">Subatomic</a>, and <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2901742">its submission to the game jam</a>. My account is <a href = "https://itch.io/profile/blazecus">blazecus</a>, you can see the other game jams I've done on there. These are all games that were developed in a few days - or less, given that we're often busy on the weekends too. They're made in hours - so there isn't going to be any polish.

"Built to scale" as a theme led to many similar games, I thought. Lots of spins on common types of games, with the ability to change your own size or that of the world. To me, this theme seemed best suited for puzzle games, which I only saw a few of. The invented genre of "2d platformer with changing scales" definitely seemed to be the most popular type of game, but ultimately I felt it wasn't too interesting.

We ended up making a puzzle game, although the controls and world were a 2D platformer. The concept of the game was a Portal-like puzzle game - portals would work as they do in Portal, except that portals could change the size of objects. Each level would involve using the size and weights of objects and the player to solve puzzles. For example, momentum is preserved through portals, so when you changed the scale (and thus, mass), you would get a slower or faster object. As some puzzles required certain speeds, this was used as a puzzle mechanic. Other important ones were just shapes of objects needed to make bridges or fit the object through an area, or the weights of objects being too heavy to move at certain sizes but also need to be heavy enough to press a pressure plate.
