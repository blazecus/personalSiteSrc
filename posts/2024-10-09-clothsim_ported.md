I will write much more in this post later but I wanted to first show off that I've finally done this after wading through a ton of boilerplate. Big thanks to Ã‰lie Michel for his work on <a href = "https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/index.html">this tutorial series</a>, it was super helpful. This project will open a lot of doors for me for future wgpu projects.
