Compute Shader Cloth Simulator - C++ and WebGPU
</div>

<div class = "page-summary">
A repeat of my earlier compute shader implementation of a cloth simulation on WebGPU, now built with C++ and available as an interactive demo on this site

This demo uses compute shaders, so it will only work if you have WebGPU enabled, which you can do in Chrome <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu/troubleshooting-tips#:~:text=WebGPU%20is%20disabled%20when%20the,webgpu%20flag%20and%20restart%20Chrome.">like this</a>. Big thanks to Ã‰lie Michel for his work on <a href = "https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/index.html">this tutorial series</a>, it was super helpful, and for help on his related discord. If you want to see how this program works, you can look in <a href= "https://github.com/blazecus/WebGPU_Cloth">my repository</a>. There is code from Elie's tutorial in my repo (particularly the code in Application.cpp and ResourceManager.cpp).

I might make a more comprehensive write-up eventually, but there is a very quick explanation of how this type of cloth simulator works on my previous <a href = {{site.base_url}}/posts/2024-09-11-clothsim.html>Rust implementation</a> of the same simulation.

Now it has lighting!! I'll only include one screenshot, since it's better to experience the demo yourself at the link.
