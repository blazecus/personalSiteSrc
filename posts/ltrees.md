I wrote two presentations for this project already - <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11wzZYV0UGqM01XX659EanH6TFNGjIoHaWYq191uWrS0/edit?usp=sharing">one</a> was for a public presentation class, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y0om-8VN2joUp4ZKrymeJy1KFlVyNw7cFZEKw-2bOo0/edit?usp=sharing">another</a> was for the original class that I made the project for. They do an ok-ish job of explaining the project, but I'm going to repeat the process on this article to some degree. I'll post the screenshots again, and go over the basic concepts. One cool thing about this project is that it actually got shared in the MIT publication, MIT Spectrum, in a review of the class I built this project for. The class was 6.837 - Intro to Computer Graphics - and here is the <a href = "https://computing.mit.edu/news/algorithms-for-art/">article</a> featuring my work. I ended up being a TA for this class later on in college.
