The proportions are not perfect on the main body, but it's not bad either

My first beetle design! Definitely a milestone for origamists. This one is a simple box-pleated model, with some maneuvering on the abdomen to get the color-changed white spot in the correct location. You may notice that the white spot is larger than in real life - this was on purpose, as I wanted the feature to be easily recognizable. I wrote a post on the process of designing this beetle <a href = {{site.base_url}}/posts/2024-08-28-bp_beetle.html>here</a> - it has brief explanations of what box pleating does and the general idea of how i came up with the beetle. 

Anyway, I also made a YouTube video for this one, which I'm pretty happy about. Unfortunately the folding goes out of frame quite a bit - something I'll definitely work on for the next times.

Here are a bunch of other photos of the final result.

I found the flat shape of beetles harder to photograph than the humanoid models I've designed in the past.
