<p>Pachacuti is the common Anglicization of Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui, the ninth Sapa Inka, and the leader to take Cuzco from a city-state of regional importance to a growing imperial power.</p>
<p>Pachacuti gained power as a younger son by defending Cuzco from the Chanka, a rival city-state, while his father fled. He ultimately finished the war in the Inka's favor, and faced a power struggle with his family members in the aftermath, who were jealous of his popularity. Likely with the advantage of popularity and military loyalty, he won power from his father and older brother after they attempted to assassinate him.</p>
<p>He expanded the kingdom in every direction, and implemented reforms that turned the small kingdom into an empire - now called Tawantinsuyu, the land of four quarters.</p>
<p>Within a century, Tawantinsuyu would become the largest empire yet to exist in the southern hemisphere, ruling a population of millions in the Andes and the surrounding lowlands.</p>
<p>This was my first model I ever designed. I used box pleating and BP studio to concoct a general idea of the shape, folded the base, then free-folded much of the details. Some aspects had to be improvised, like the cloth/flag on the halberd (called a kunka kuchuna in Quechua - these were huge class symbols afforded only to those of great power). I added this only because I left too much paper on the spear. The same goes for the long headdress that covers much of the cape behind. A lot of this paper could have been used to have longer limbs and better proportions - some day I may come back to this model.</p>
<p>Based on this statue of Pachacuti in Cuzco.</p>
